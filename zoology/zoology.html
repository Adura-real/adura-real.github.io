                GENETICS
                </h3>  
                 <p>Genetics is the science which deals with the mechanisms responsible for similarities  and differences among closely related species. The term ‘genetic’ was coined by  W.Batesmanin 1905. It is derived from the Greek word ‘genesis’ meaning grow into or to  become.  
                So, genetic is the study of heredity and hereditary variations it is the study of transmission of  body features ; I’e, similarities and difference, from parents to offspring’s and the laws  related to this transmission</p> 
                
                <h3 id="variation">
                VARIATION
                </h3>
                <p> 
                 Any difference between individual organisms or groups of organisms of any species,  caused either by genetic difference or by the effect of environmental factors, is called  variation. Variation can be shown in physical appearance, metabolism, behavior, learning and  mental ability, and other obvious characters.</p>
                 
                 <h3 id="TYPES-OF-VARIATION">
                TYPES OF VARIATION </h3> 
                 There are two types of variation.  
                 <h4>
                Genotypic variations:</h4> -<p> Genotypic variations are caused by differences in the number or  structure of chromosomes or by difference in the genes carried by the chromosome. Height,  eye colour, body forms are some of the genotypic variations. A variation cannot be identified  as genotypic by simply observing the organism unless breeding experiments are performed  under controlled environmental conditions.</p>
                <h4> 
                Somatic variations:</h4>
                <p> - Somatic variations may result from several factors, such as climate,  food supply, and actions of other organisms. These variations are not due to differences in  genes or chromosomes, and in general are not transmitted future generations. Hence they are  not significance in the process of evolution. </p>
                <h4> 
                 Heredity:</h4>
                 <p> - Is defined as the transmission of characteristics from parents to offspring’s.  It can also be defined as resemblances among individuals related to descent. It also means the  inheritance of like qualities or characters from the one generation to the next and to successive  generations.</p>
                 
                 <h3 id="MENDELS-LAWS-OF-HEREDITY">
                MENDELS LAWS OF HEREDITY</h3>  
                 Gregor Johann Mendel (1822-1844) is known as the father of genetics as he was the first to  demonstrate the mechanism of transmission of characters from one generation to the other.  He carried out his work on garden pea, pisum sativum. He selected 7 pairs of contrasting traits  of garden peas.  
                Mendel’s gave three laws or principles of inheritance.<ol>
                    <li>
                <h4> Law of dominance:</h4> States that in heterozygous condition among two alleles of a  character the alleles which expresses itself is dominant and the one which can’t express is  recessive. </li> 
                <li><h4>Law of segregation: </h4>States that although the alleles of a character remain together for  long time but they do not mix with each other and separate at the time of gametogenesis so  that each gamete receives only one alleles of a character either dominant or recessive.</li>  
                <li><h4> Law of Independent assortment: </h4>states that alleles of a character can undergo any  sort of combination to give rise to a phenotype differing from both the parents.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3 id="mendel-experiment">MENDEL’S EXPERIMENT  </h3>
                <p>
                In 1857 Mendel began a series of experiments on the pea plant (Pisum Sativum) to  study the pattern of inheritance of various characters. He chose pea plant for three reasons.  First, pea plants are self-poillinating .Second they are easy to cultivate. Third, they have a  sharply defined characters. Mendels chose to study seven different characters in this plant.  Each characters such as height, seed shape, seed colour, etc., had two sharply defined and  contrasting traits (e.g, dwarfstem and tall stem, wrinkled seed and smooth seed, yellow seed  and green seed). He crossed a variety of pea plants, carrying a particular traits (e.g. tallness )  of a character (such as height) with another variety having a contrasting traits (e.g, dwarfness)  of the same character. These two types were called parental types (p or p1).</p>
