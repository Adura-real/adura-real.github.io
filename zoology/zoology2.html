    GENETICS AND HEREDITY </h2> 
    <p>
    that was produced out of these two was called first filial generation (F1). When these were  self –polinated , the second generation that was produced was called second filial generation  (F2). 
    The result of Mendel’s experiment followed a pattern, which is as follows:  Whenever two varieties of a character were crossed, the F1 plants showed only one of  the traits, the other traits never appeared. It did not matter whether the trait came from the  pollen or ova.  
    The traits that did not appear in F1 reappeared in the F2 but in the ratio ¼ of the total number  of the plants. </p>
    
    <p>
    Mendel called the substance or agent responsible for each trait a ‘factor’. According  to Mendel, the trait that did not appear in the F1 was not destroyed or altered. He explained  the phenomenon by which one trait appeared in the F1 and the other did not. He said that the  trait which appeared in the F1 was domi;nant and the one which did not appear was recessive.  </p>

    <p>
    Mendel called that each genetic character was represented or controlled by a pair of  unit factors, or elements.(Later on, the unit factors became known as alleles or allelomorphs .  when the term ‘gene’ was coined and defined, the allele became synonymous with the gene.)  One of the alleles came from one parent and the other from the other parent. The first  generation plants of his experiments were all tall plants. The representing dwarfness could  not be expressed in the first generation because it was dominated by the allele representing  tallness. in other words the allele for tallness was dominant and the allele for dwarfness was  recessive  </p>

    <h3 id="notations">

    <p>
    The dominant trait is written with a capital letter .for example tallness is represented as T and  darkness is represented with the corresponding small letters t. if tallness is due to both the  dominant alleles, it is written as TT. If tallness is due to only one dominant trait then it is  written as Tt. If both the alleles are receives, making the organism draft, then it is written as  tt. A homozygous condition is one in which both alleles are of the same nature, for example  .Tt or tt. Heterozygous condition (here, the two alleles are of different nature) is written as Tt.  In a dihybrid cross, two characters are taken into account .Hence the notation for the  homozygous domint would be AABB, and for the homozygous receives it would be aabb.  When the gamete is formed the traits are separated, as the chromosome number during  meiosis is halved.  </p>

    <h3 id="laws-of-segregation">
    LAW OF SEGREGATION </h3>
    <p> 
    When the tall plants in F1 were crossed among themselves , the F2 generation ad 75% tall  plants and 25% dwarf plants (ratio 3:1)This led Mendel to conclude that the alleles  representing darkness were intact and were neither lost nor contaminated .Medals study with  one character (monohybride cross)led to the formulation of the law or principle of  segregation . This means that although the alleles of a character remain together, they are  separated in subsequent generations.</p>
    <h3 id="laws-of-independent">  
    LAW OF INDEPENDENT ASSORTMENT  </h3>
    <P>
    After studying the inheritance of one pair of contrasting characters, Mendel went on  to take two characters (Dihybrid cross) into account .He crossed a plant having smooth and  yellow seeds with a plant having wrinkled and green seeds. All F1 plants had smooth and  yellow seeds .when a Certain number of F1 plants were grown and self-crossed they gave rise  to four types of seeds:315 smooth yellow, 108 smooth green,101 wrinkled yellow , and 32  wrinkled green. When its ratio is worked out ,it comes to 9:3:3:1.  </P>
    <p>
     This shows that the chances for the pea seeds to be smooth or wrinkled has no  bearing on their chances to be yellow or green. In other words, each pair of alleles is  independently separate of the other pair. This is the principle of independent assortment.</p>
