 GENETICS AND HEREDITY </h2>

MONOHYBRID CROSS  </h3>
<p>
A cross between living organisms in which only one pair of contrasting characters is  taken into consideration is called monohybrid. The organism, which are crossed, may vary in  more than one pair of contrasting characters.  </p>
<p>
 While performing monohybride cross between two pea plants Mendel took height into  consideration. He crossed a pure tall pea plant (TT) with a pure dwarf pea plant (tt).  Emasculation of flowers and reciprocal transfer of pollen to stigma s made the cross .Seeds  formed were collected and sworn in next season. This generation was given the name first  generation of F1 generation . plants of this generation allowed to self-pollinate and seeds  obtained were collected and sown in following season. The plants produced from the seeds  were found to be tall as well as dwarf in the ratio of 3:1. These plants were given the name  second filial or F2 generation and the ratio was called phyenotpic ratio.  </p>
 <p>
 When tall plants of this generation were allowed to undergo self pollination and seeds  collected were sown in next season , tall as well as dwarf plants were produced which  indicated that some tall plants contained dwarf allele. However, when dwarf plants were  allowed to breed, they produced only dwarf plants. Thus another ratio 1:2:1. A graphic  representation of monohybride cross is as under: </p>
 <h3 id="dihybrid-cross"> 
DIHYBRIDE CROSS</h3>
<p>  
 Dihybride cross may be defined as a cross between two individuals in which two pairs  of contrasting character are taking into consideration. In this cross, mendel took color of  seeds coat and texture of seed into consideration.  </p>
 <p>
 Mendel crossed a pea plant producing pure yellow and round seeds with another pea  plant producing pure green and wrinkled seeds. Emasculating flowers of each variety and  placing pollen of one type on the stigmas of the flowers of the other variety made the cross.  Seeds collected from cross pollinated plants were all yellow and round indicating that yellow  character is dominant over green character and roundness is dominant over wrinkle-less the  seeds were sown in next season and the plants produced, representing first filial F1 plants  were found to be of four types namely yellow round, yellow wrinkled, green round and green  wrinkled. The plants which produced these seeds were roughly found to be in the ratio 9 : 3 :  3 : 1. The plants obtained from these seeds were given the name F2 generation and the ratio  came to be called phenotypic ratio of dihybride cross. A graphic account of the cross is as  under:</p>

 <h3 id="backcross">  
BACK CROSS:</h3> - It may be defined as the cross between F1 hybride and of its parents. It is  used by animal and plant breeders to rapidly improve a breed or variety by making a useful  trait (gene) homozygous, or ‘pure’. It is of two kinds namely test cross and out cross. </p>

<p><h3 id="testcross">TEST CROSS: - </h3>It may be defined as the cross between F1 hybride and it receiving parents.  It is used by plant breeders to the validity of cross. It can be explained by following  examples.  </p>
<p>
    <h3 id="chromosomes">
CHROMOSOMES  </h3>
Chromosome is a Greek word meaning chrome means color and soma means body.  Chromosomes are the thread-like structure present in the nucleons of cell which contain  hereditary information of the cell. Chromosomes are made up of DNA and proteins. The  characteristics travel from the parents to the offspring in the form of genes situated in the  chromosomes present in the nuclei of the gametes. The number of chromosomes is constant  for all individuals in a spices and each one of them has a fixed and equal number of  chromosomes. The chromosomes of each species occur in pairs.  </p>

<h3 id="their-function">
FUNCTIONS OF CHROMOSOMES</h3>
<ol> 
<li>Chromosomes are hereditary vehicles that contain genes. All the hereditary  information is located in the genes.  </li>
<li> Chromosomes control the synthesis of structural proteins and thus help in cell  division, cell repair and cell growth. </li>
</ol>
